        <p>The time of second half year of 2011 in ZhuHai is important to me. I learn a lot and grown a lot in that time.</p>
<h2 id="The_Job">The Job</h2><p>I quit the job. Why? I told my boss that I want to take a look the outside world, a different company, a different environment maybe what I need. I told my friends that I feel tired and just want to have a rest. But, later on, I know the really thing I want is time, free time. Free time means the free.</p>
<h2 id="My_Ambition">My Ambition</h2><p>I have time now, So, I deeply think a lot of things. Soon, few days past. At some moment, I found the physic world is too reasonable, just like a huge machine drives by gears; the age of the world is so long, even to the whold history  time of  the human race no more than a spark. However long our life and no mater how much things we do the world will not change anything for us. In some case, seems we are stand still on this world. So, my ambition to change the world failed, sad. If I have no goal where can I go? Compare my ambition with others, noting interested me. Everything is meanness for me.! Ha-ha, my heart is empty! That is really great feeling. With the thought want nothing, I found a interesting thing to do, the mental world of human!</p>
<h2 id="What_is_Knowledge?">What is Knowledge?</h2><p>An empty heart make me happy all the time, but I doubt this is a good living way. The world must have something worth for me to pursuit.</p>
<p>There are some questions that you may asked before, but no one can answer them, I call them the ultimate questions. The<br>questions may look like:</p>
<p><em>Where do we come from? </em><br><em>Who really am I?  </em><br><em>What is the purpose of the world? </em></p>
<p>We are looking for answers of these questions for thousand of years, may even more long. we build kinds of philosophies base, and create science.  Toady,  these question still unknown. We need more and more knowledge, more knowledge means more time. How long, God knows!</p>
<p>What is the knowledge? Knowledge is: the facts that they really exist; the rule that control the world; the theory that works at everywhere and in any time. History generates the fact; science generates is the rule; mathematics generates the theory. Mathematics knowledge is the pure true knowledge.</p>
<p>I am looking for the truth of the world!</p>
